## The What
The School Administration System is just what it sounds like. A program to administer and organize data
in a school environment. For example, list classes that are being taught, who are teaching those classes,
and also who are attending each class. Extensive information can be recorded about teachers, students and
other parts of the school environment, including contact information, class attendance etc.

The program is being developed using Qt 5.9 and C++.

## The Why
After having worked for a few language schools who insist on keeping records of 100+ students using Excel spreadsheets,
and observing everything getting more and more disorganized as the tables grew larger, I was finally asked
to create a program that could help them deal with the problem. Of course, there are already several excellent
alternatives out there, much better than I could come up with all by myself. But since they are not willing to
pay the little extra to keep their records organized, they basically begged me to do it instead.

### Progress
The program is still in the early development stage.
